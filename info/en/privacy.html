        To optimize the use of this website for you, we use the analysis tool Google Analytics. This is a standard
        analysis tool of Google Inc. For analyzing purposes Google uses so-called "Cookies" which contain information
        about your browsing behavior to evaluate accordingly. The analysis of your data is anonymous. The tracking code
        from Google on our websites has been amended so that your IP address is shortened by Google by its last digits
        before the analysis is performed. Traceability on your person as well as a compilation of these data with those
        already known by Google is thus in principle no longer possible. The acquisition, anonymization and analyzing of
        user data takes place on written behalf of the site operator (see imprint) by Google. You have the option to
        restrict or prevent the use of cookies entirely by modifying the settings of your browser program accordingly. The
        prevention of cookies, however, could lead to not being able to use all features of this website. You also have
        the option of restricting Google Analytics to only use your user data and analysis of your browsing behavior by
        downloading and installing the specially developed by Google browser-plugin available at the following link:
