        To optimize the use of this website for you, we use the analysis tool Google Analytics.
        This is a standard analysis tool of Google Inc. For analyzing purposes Google uses so-called "Cookies"
        which contain information about your browsing behavior to evaluate accordingly.
        The analysis of your data is anonymous. The tracking code from Google on our websites has been amended
        so that your IP address is shortened by Google by its last digits before the analysis is performed.
        Traceability on your person as well as a compilation of these data with those already known by Google
        is thus in principle no longer possible.
        The acquisition, anonymization and analyzing of user data takes place on written behalf of the site operator (see imprint) by Google.
        You have the option to restrict or prevent the use of cookies entirely by modifying the settings of your browser program accordingly.
        The prevention of cookies, however, could lead to not being able to use all features of this website.
        You also have the option of restricting Google Analytics to only use your user data and analysis of your browsing behavior by
        downloading and installing the specially developed by Google browser-plugin available at the following link:
        http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
